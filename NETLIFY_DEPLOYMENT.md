### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to GitHub and select the repository: `Joshua-JD-Deleon/lsat-study-tool`
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build`

```

## Build Configuration

The project includes a comprehensive `netlify.toml` with:

- **Performance headers** for optimal caching
- **Security headers** (HSTS, XSS protection, etc.)
- **PWA optimization** (Service Worker headers)
- **Compression settings** for faster loading

## PWA Features Verified
